# Sample Project

## How to build
Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already. 

If you have not installed Grunt then open Node.js command prompt and run:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Then at the Node.js command prompt type:

    cd SampleProject
    npm install

This will install several Grunt plugins. Now you are ready to run Grunt. At the Node.js command prompt type:

    grunt

Now start Visual Studio, open the .sln file, build and run.
